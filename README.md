## Overview ##
In its initial inception (this one, the one you are looking at right now),
causerie will be more of a glorified preprocessor than an actual compiler.
Nevertheless, it will successfully compile code from its own Smalltalk-derived
syntax, to C, and then to a finished program.

For more information, please see the [Wiki](http://causerie.circusmachina.com).

## Compiling ##
### With Lazarus ###
The initial version of causerie is written in [Free Pascal][] using [Lazarus][].
The Lazarus project files are found in the top-level directory (the same 
directory as this file) and, when finished, will allow you to build causerie 
from source.  Simply open `cause.lpi` in Lazarus, then choose `Build` from the 
`Run` menu (or press `Shift+F9` as of Lazarus 1.2.2).

On Windows, Lazarus will be the preferred method of building causerie from 
source.

### With GNU `MAKE` ###
If you would prefer not to use Lazarus, you will be able to build causerie using
a provided `Makefile`; note, however, that you will still need Lazarus 
installed, as well as GNU `make`, in order for this to work.  The reason that 
you still need Lazarus is the base library (`classwork.pp`) relies on the 
package `LazUtils` in order to handle UTF-8-encoded strings.

The makefile will be generated by `fpcmake`, which I haven't used before, but 
based on the available options described in the online manual, it does not 
appear that using the makefile will produce directory names that are as 
organized as when compiling with Lazarus.  In particular, it does not seem that 
the automatically-generated `Makefile` will be able to place the compiled units 
and the final binary in a subfolder of `lib/` or `build/` that is appropriate 
for the target platform.  The end result should be the same, however.

The initial version of causerie was built with Free Pascal 2.6.4, so you will
need at least this version to compile.  It may be that older versions will also
successfully compile causerie, but I have not tested this myself.  In the
future, causerie will compile itself, so hopefully this will not be a matter of
concern for too long.

## Installing ##
This cannot yet be done, as only the base library is finished and the parsing
library is nearing completion.  This file will be updated as we get closer to
a functional program.
