    { Constructs a "pretty" class name for the class.

      This method operates on the assumption that:
      @unorderedList(
        @item(The class name is an English name -- this method is not
              internationalized.)
        @item(The class name begins with "A" or "An".)
        @item(The class name can be separated into meaningful words wherever
              an upper-case character is found.)
      )

      A class named "ABalloonAnimal" will be rendered as "a balloon animal"
      by this method.  The routine calls @link(Charstring.expandCamelCase) on
      the result of a call to @code(TObject.className), then converts the
      result to lower-case before returning it.

      This routine presently only operates on ASCII strings.

      In the base implementation of this method, the result of calling this
      routine is cached, since there is no need to recalculate the display name
      every time the method is called unless it becomes possible to dynamically
      alter class names.  The cached result is returned for subsequent calls.
    }
    function displayName: string; virtual;

    { Constructs and returns a string representation of the object.

      The base implmentation of this method simply calls
      @link(APrintingObject.displayName) and returns the result of that call.
    }
    function toString: string; override;

    { Print a string representation of the object to the specified stream.

      The base implementation of this method first calls
      @link(APrintingObject.toString) and then prints the result of that call
      to @code(Dest).

      @returns(The total number of bytes written to @code(Dest).)
